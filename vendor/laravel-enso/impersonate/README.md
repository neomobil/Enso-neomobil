### Details

- allows a user to impersonate another user, by using a middleware
- permits testing and debugging from the perspective of another user, without needing his credentials
- comes with its own controller and routes that permit starting and stopping the impersonation process
- depends on [Permission Manager](https://github.com/laravel-enso/PermissionManager) in order to be able to verify permissions

### Installation Steps

1. Run the migrations `php artisan migrate`

2. Use the `Impersonate` trait inside your user model - as this will allow the middleware to work correctly 

4. Use the `api/core/impersonate/{user}` and `api/core/impersonate/stop` routes to start, respectively stop the impersonation    

### Notes

The access for the impersonation process is determined by the (admin) user's access to the impersonation routes.

The [Laravel Enso Core](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Core) package comes with this package included.
