### Features

- can be used to attach addresses to any entity, via using a polymorphic relationship
- allows saving of multiple addresses for an addresable entity
- features and easy flow for setting the default address 
- comes with an additional table for Countries, with all the countries pre-populated
- brings its own free-form form for the edit and creation of addresses
- has a publishable configuration file, where you can define the addresable models, 
set custom validations via the Laravel syntax, as well as other options
- comes with its own VueJS component `addresses` 
- includes an `Addressable` trait, for defining relationships and attributes
- the VueJS component as well as the whole package is designed to be extendable, 
so you could create a custom versions for specific countries 

### Usage
1. the configuration should be published, and inside you need to define the addresable types
2. use the package's `Addresable` trait for the models you want to make addressable
3. insert the `Addreses` vue component where required in your pages/components. The `id` and `type` parameters are 
the essential ones.

```
<addresses :id="modelId" type="modelAlias">
</addresses>
```

### Options

- `type` - string, the addressable model alias you set in the config | required
- `id` - number, the id of the addressable model | required
- `theme` - string, the class used for setting the styling of the box. Defaults to `primary`.
- `solid` - boolean, a flag for showing a solid type of a box. Defaults to `false`.
- `open` - boolean, a flag for the starting style (open/closed) of the box. Defaults to `true`.
- `title` - string, the text for the box title. Defaults to null.

Note that the labels are take from the global Store - if needed you may customize them in `config/labels.php`.

### Publishes
- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=addresses-config` - configuration file
- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=addresses-form` - form used for creating/editing addresses
- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enso-config` - a common alias for when wanting to update the config,
once a newer version is released
