### Features

- uses [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) and [Laravel's notification infrastructure](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/broadcasting) to bring minimal-setup notification functionality
- users can also be notified via email
- allows the lazy loading of notifications
- read and unread notifications are visually differentiated and can be manually/automatically marked as read, as well as cleared
- polymorphic relationships are used, in order to be able to attach notifications to any entity

### Installation Steps


If not registered already, register on [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) and then set your credentials in your `.env` file:

    ````
    BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher
    PUSHER_APP_ID=
    PUSHER_APP_KEY=
    PUSHER_APP_SECRET=
    ````

Once set, these credentials are set during the application init phase.

### Notes

The [Laravel Enso](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Enso) package comes with this package included.

Depends on:
 - [Core](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Core) for middleware 
 - [Structure manager](https://github.com/laravel-enso/StructureManager) for the migrations
 - [PusherPhpServer](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-php-server) for the integration with pusher
