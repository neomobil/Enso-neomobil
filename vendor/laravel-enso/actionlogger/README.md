User actions logger dependency for [Laravel](https://laravel.com).

### Features

- creates the `action-logger` middleware, the `action_logs` table and the `ActionLog` model
- will log all access routes covered by the `action-logger` middleware
- comes with the `ActionLogger` trait that defines the relationship to the `ActionLog` model, and should be included in your user model
- each entry will record `user_id`, `url`, `route` name, http `action` verb and timestamps

### Installation Steps

1. Run the migrations `php artisan migrate`

2. Include the `action-logger` middleware on the routes that you want covered

3. Add the `ActionLogger` trait on your user model, so you may retrieve the user's  actions

### Notes

The [Laravel Enso Core](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Core) package comes with this package included.

If using the package together with Laravel Enso, the list of actions for an user are available in each user's profile page.
