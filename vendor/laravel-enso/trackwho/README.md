Create, update and delete authoring tracking dependency for [Laravel Enso](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Enso).

### Details

- keeps track of the user that performed various actions on a record/model
- requires the presence of the proper model attributes / table columns
- once the structure is set up, by using the proper trait, the information is added automatically

### Use

1. In the Model where you want to track the creating, updating or deleting user, add

    ```
    use CreatedBy, UpdatedBy, DeletedBy;
    ```

2. Make sure that the model's table has the `created_by` | `updated_by` | `deleted_by` field(s)

### Notes

The traits will also define relationships with the `User` model so you can call `$model->createdBy`, `$model->updatedBy`, `$model->deletedBy`.

`DeletedBy` can be useful where you are using soft deletes.

The [Laravel Enso Core](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Core) package comes with this package included.
